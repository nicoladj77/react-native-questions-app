The app has been created with [`react-native init`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)

The structure is the following:

`src/actions` contains the Redux actions
`src/components` contains reusable components (I've left most of the code in the screens, but have componentized the answer display on the end screen
`src/reducers` contains Redux reducers
`src/screen` contains react-navigation screens
`src/styles` contains common styles
